    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are Tejas, Aryan, and Aditya — first-year Computer Science students at MUJ. As freshers, we quickly realized
      how unorganized and outdated the mess system felt when it came to accessing menus, sharing feedback, or making
      collective decisions.

      So, we built this platform to fix that.

      Our website gives students a central hub for everything mess-related — from viewing daily and weekly menus to
      participating in mess food voting, giving feedback, and staying updated with any important announcements or
      changes.

      This project is more than just a website. It’s our way of making student life smoother and giving everyone a voice
      in what they eat.

      Made by students, for students — and we’re just getting started.
